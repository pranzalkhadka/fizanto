# Lending Club Model Assumptions and Limitations

## Core Assumptions

### 1. Data Representativeness
- Sample of 300 approved loans is sufficient for POC modeling
- Default rate in sample represents real-world patterns
- Feature distributions are representative of population
- Selected features capture key risk factors

### 2. Feature Stability
- FICO score remains a reliable indicator of creditworthiness
- DTI calculation methodology is consistent
- Income and loan amount relationships are stable
- Grade assignments reflect consistent risk levels

### 3. Feature Engineering Assumptions
- Log transformation effectively normalizes income and loan amount
- FICO score binning captures meaningful risk segments
- DTI categorization reflects relevant risk levels
- One-hot encoding adequately represents categorical variables

### 4. Model Training Assumptions
- 80/20 random split provides reliable validation
- No significant temporal effects in the data
- Class imbalance is representative of population
- Feature relationships are relatively stable

## Known Limitations

### 1. Data Limitations
- Small sample size (300 records)
- Only approved loans included
- Limited to binary outcome (Default/Fully Paid)
- No temporal information for validation
- No rejected application data

### 2. Model Limitations
- Binary classification simplifies complex risk assessment
- Gradient boosting has limited interpretability
- No cross-validation due to data size
- Limited feature interactions captured
- No ensemble or challenger models

### 3. Feature Limitations
- Basic feature set compared to full lending data
- No behavioral or time-series features
- Limited categorical feature engineering
- No interaction features created
- No external data sources

### 4. Performance Boundaries
Optimal performance within observed ranges:
- FICO scores: 580-850
- DTI: 0-150%
- Annual Income: $20,000-$300,000
- Loan Amount: $1,000-$40,000

### 5. POC Scope Limitations
- No production deployment considerations
- No monitoring system implemented
- No A/B testing capability
- No model refresh process
- Limited validation scope

## Risk Factors

### 1. Model Risk
- Potential overfitting due to small sample
- Limited validation capability
- Feature importance stability unknown
- Performance on new data uncertain
- No temporal validation

### 2. Data Risk
- Sample may not be representative
- Limited feature set
- Missing important risk factors
- No data refresh process
- Static snapshot only

### 3. Implementation Risk
- No production-ready code
- No API implementation
- No monitoring system
- No model versioning
- Limited documentation

## Future Improvements

### 1. Data Enhancements
- Increase sample size
- Add rejected applications
- Include temporal information
- Add behavioral features
- Include external data

### 2. Model Enhancements
- Implement cross-validation
- Add model interpretability
- Create ensemble models
- Add confidence metrics
- Improve feature engineering

### 3. Implementation Needs
- Production code development
- API development
- Monitoring system
- Model versioning
- Comprehensive testing

### 4. Validation Requirements
- Out-of-time validation
- Cross-validation
- Feature importance stability
- Performance across segments
- Bias testing
