        <!-- Model Overview -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Model Overview</h2>
            <p>The Credit Risk Model is designed to predict 12-month loan default probabilities using machine learning techniques, supporting the institution's loan approval decision-making process. The model employs LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework with leaf-wise tree growth and second-order gradient optimization, which was selected for its superior performance with a recall rate of 82.96%, AUC-ROC of 0.9448, and 93% overall accuracy. Built on a comprehensive dataset of 300,000 loan application records merged from eight distinct data sources, the model processes 122 variables spanning applicant background information and credit history. Key predictive features include EXT_SOURCE_2 (external credit score), AMT_INCOME_TOTAL (client income), DAYS_REGISTRATION (days since registration change), and regional population statistics. The model particularly excels at detecting potential defaults, prioritizing recall to minimize financial losses while maintaining balanced performance through optimized threshold adjustments.</p>
            <p>The modeling approach addresses several challenges inherent to credit risk assessment, including highly imbalanced data (with only 8% of records indicating defaults) and complex feature interactions. Extensive data preprocessing techniques were implemented, including handling missing values, feature standardization, correlation analysis, and stratified sampling to maintain class distribution. The model undergoes continuous monitoring to ensure robust performance across varying economic conditions, with particular attention to potential degradation during economic downturns. This validated model serves as a critical component in the institution's risk management framework, providing objective, consistent credit risk assessments that enable more informed lending decisions while appropriately balancing business objectives with prudent risk management practices.</p>

        <!-- Validation Scope and Objectives -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Validation Scope and Objectives</h2>
            <p>This validation exercise encompasses a comprehensive assessment of the LightGBM-based credit risk model designed to predict 12-month loan default probabilities. The scope includes thorough examination of model design, development methodology, performance metrics, theoretical soundness, and implementation effectiveness. Key validation criteria focus on the model's accuracy (particularly its recall of 0.8296 and AUC-ROC of 0.9448), robustness when handling imbalanced data (1:10 default-to-non-default ratio), appropriate data preprocessing techniques, and effectiveness of feature selection processes. The validation specifically evaluates whether the model appropriately prioritizes recall to minimize financial losses from undetected defaults while maintaining reasonable precision. Our objectives include: (1) verifying conceptual soundness and alignment with industry standards for credit risk modeling; (2) assessing model performance against defined benchmarks; (3) confirming data quality management and preprocessing techniques including handling of missing values and feature engineering; (4) evaluating model calibration and discrimination abilities; (5) examining implementation controls and monitoring frameworks; and (6) determining whether the model's limitations, assumptions, and uncertainties are properly documented and understood. This validation aims to provide an independent assessment of model risk and confirm regulatory compliance while offering actionable recommendations for model enhancement where applicable.</p>

        <!-- Validation Methodology -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Validation Methodology</h2>
            <p>The validation of the credit risk model was conducted in accordance with regulatory guidance on model risk management, employing a comprehensive multi-faceted approach to ensure model soundness and reliability. Our methodology involved stratified sampling techniques to address the inherent class imbalance in credit default data, with an 80/20 train-test split maintaining the 2:8 default-to-non-default ratio throughout the validation process. We implemented both quantitative and qualitative assessment procedures, including conceptual soundness evaluation, outcome analysis, and ongoing performance monitoring. For quantitative validation, we prioritized AUC-ROC metrics to evaluate discriminatory power and recall measures to assess the model's capability to identify potential defaults, recognizing that false negatives carry significantly higher costs than false positives in credit risk scenarios. Additionally, the validation incorporated k-fold cross-validation and out-of-time testing to verify model stability and robustness across varying economic conditions. Feature analysis was conducted through correlation assessment and importance metrics, with particular attention to key predictive variables such as income levels, registration duration, and external credit scores to ensure business intuition alignment. The validation team maintained independence from the model development group throughout the process, ensuring objective scrutiny of all model assumptions, limitations, and intended applications in accordance with sound model risk management practices.</p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on comprehensive validation testing, the credit risk model utilizing LightGBM demonstrates strong predictive capabilities with an AUC-ROC of 0.9448 and a recall rate of 0.8296 at a 0.1 threshold. This performance indicates the model effectively identifies over 80% of potential defaults while maintaining 93% overall accuracy, despite challenges from highly imbalanced data (1:10 default-to-non-default ratio). The model's key strengths include its ability to leverage important features such as income level, registration duration, and regional demographic factors to make reliable creditworthiness assessments. However, limitations exist in the current implementation, particularly in the suboptimal feature engineering approach where uniform one-hot encoding was applied despite LightGBM's native categorical feature handling capabilities. Additionally, the model may experience performance degradation during economic downturns, requiring enhanced monitoring procedures. Overall, the validated model represents an effective tool for default risk prediction while acknowledging specific improvement opportunities in categorical feature handling and economic sensitivity monitoring to ensure sustained performance across varying market conditions.</p>
